This program was built about a year before this publication.
Purpose: To learn programming and understand how basic encryption works.

This project came to mind while I was learning about networking and encryption.
It’s a simple encryption program that allows the user to enter text, which the app then encrypts — including both letters and numbers.

I only implemented the encryption part of the program, as I got caught up with schoolwork and other projects at the time.
Even so, it was a fun and valuable experience that helped me improve my understanding of programming concepts and basic encryption logic.
